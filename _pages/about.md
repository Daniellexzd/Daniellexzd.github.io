I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Linguistics at Simon Fraser University, where I conducted research at the [Language and Brain Lab](https://www.sfu.ca/lablab.html) and the [Language Learning and Development Lab](https://www.sfu.ca/langdev.html), mentored by [Dr. Henny Yeung](https://www.sfu.ca/linguistics/about/people/faculty/yeung.html) and [Dr.Yue Wang](https://www.sfu.ca/people/yuew.html). My research integrates L2 speech perception and production, spoken word recognition using eye-tracking techniques, and audio-visual processing (specifically, how perceivers' looking patterns at a talking face reflect their processing of various types of speech information). In particular, my PhD dissertation focuses on L2 English leaners' adaptation to non-native English accents across different speech contexts, exploring the mechanisms behind their divergent perceptual adaptation patterns compared to native English speakers. 

The inspiration for my dissertation comes from my own experience as a first-generation Chinese immigrant in Canada’s multilingual environment. I noticed that members of my community frequently struggled to understand "non-standard" English spoken by immigrants from other linguistic backgrounds—speech that neither matched the classroom English we had learned in our home countries nor resembled the Chinese-accented English we were more familiar with. Through this research, I aim to contribute to a better understanding of how to facilitate effective communication across diverse communities, rather than reinforcing the unrealistic expectation that non-native speakers should conform to a native accent.

Beyond these research fields, I also explore the role of non-linguistic factors, such as musical abilities, in L2 learning—particularly in the acquisition of prosodic features like lexical stress.

Outside of linguistics, I enjoy reading and writing novels, especially science fiction. I’m also a sci-fi movie enthusiast and occasionally perform stand-up comedy in Chinese in downtown Vancouver.
