Music and language may be treated in some similar ways by the human perceptual system, particularly the more  musical elements of language, such as tone and stress, which are cued by acoustic cues like intensity, duration, and rhythm. Tone and stress in particular seem correspond to certain musical counterparts such as  melody and rhythm.

In the present study, the relation between second language (L2) learning and music perception  is  examined. While musicians were found to be better at encoding lexical tone or stress in a second language than non-musicians, consistent conclusions have not been reached on how different sub-domains of music perception are associated with different facets of learning L2 suprasegmentals. Our current study investigates the link between two different sub-domains of music perception, melody and rhythm, and accurate perception and production of English lexical stress by native Mandarin speakers, which was manifested by contrasts of three acoustic cues: duration, F0 and amplitude.
